Overview

AMemcheck is a memory error detector for Android. It can detect the following problems that are common in C and C++ programs.
1. Accessing memory you shouldn't, e.g. overrunning and underrunning heap blocks, overrunning the top of the stack, and accessing memory after it has been freed.
2. Incorrect freeing of heap memory, such as double-freeing heap blocks, or mismatched use of malloc versus free
3. Memory leaks.
